AGILE AND PROCESSES

What does SCRUM mean? 

Some businesses or teams might mandate this, at the BBC they leave it up to different teams to decide.  The teams we join will each have its own processes in place that we will follow. 

There was a frustration with lead times taking long time to realise ideas. 

One of first agile methodologies was RAD - 

A business wants you to be lowercase “a”. i.e. a verb
agile. They want you to be flexible and responsive, super productive etc. 

There are processes that are titlecase “A”. i.e. a noun
Agile. There are Agile processes. That facilitate the business being more agile. 

Scrum is still really popular. 
eXtreme Programming is still used. 
2001 - Agile Manifesto was born. 

Get the manifesto from the PPT 

AnAgile process should value the stuff on the right, but focus on the things on the left. 
You have to have a plan, but you’re not the slave to the plan, need to be responsive to change. 

XP Extreme Programming Project - see slide on PPT
Spike - do some stuff before we do the thing itself, to understand more about the issue. 
Release planning - planning when to release the software (but FaceBook now do that 40 times a day. 
Iteration - working on it 
Bugs - anything the user isn’t expecting. 
Also see rules on next PPT slide.  - the customer may be another team in the same company, agreed standards i.e. decide on single or double quotes, or tab or spaces to indent, test driven development is code the unit test first. Integrate often - as soon as you’re happy with it, get it in there. 
Dedicated integration computer - this is an old thing - one computer to pull everything together. 

SCRUM
You’re in a team and in that team is cross-discipline. As a team you can do everything you need to do. 
Product Manger (/ product owner) maintains the product backlog - all the things you want your product to do, and this is prioritised by the Manager, and that is constantly changing. 
The team will decide how long a Sprint is. Usually 1-3 weeks.  - We’re only going to focus on the things we’ve decided to focus on in the Sprint Planning Meeting. You work through a list and have an estimation process - decide how long you think that will take and therefore how many you can get done in next two weeks and then prioritise them. 
That list is then your Sprint Backlog - the things your team think you can get done in those 2 weeks. The Daily Scrum is a 5 minute meeting where you say what you did yesterday, what you’re doing today, and any blockers you’ve have to deal with.  Successful teams talk to each other about this, not to the Manager. 
Then the Sprint Review is a longer meeting where you present to your team and to others, what you have done. 
Sprint Retrospective - looking at your team members - how did it go, what new things should we start doing, what should we stop doing, what should we continue doing. Solution-based mindset can be harder to say than do, if there’s been a challenging sprint. Customer might be at Sprint Review, so some kids if you’re doing an App for BBC kids. And this feeds back into Sprint Planning. 
If you think you’re going to get tasks completed earlier than planned, let Manager know as soon as possible so they can be prepared to give you more stuff.

Another Agile process is KANBAN. Originated at Toyota
Find out the areas that were going slow within the manufacturing process - the production line. 
As humans, we’re not so good as doing more than one thing at a time - the cognitive load. 
Visualise your workflow and try to make 1% improvements in lots of little areas. 
PPT - each post it note is something you need to do and each stage you introduce a WIP limit - a Work In Progress limit.  (the little digit at the top). You say that a certain team will only have 6 things to do in Pending, 3 in Analysis. For good workflow you are aiming to just do one thing in each column. 
You can see in the diagram that the Test column is the bottleneck. But also this is a very linear model so you might use KANBAN for the two week spirit and Scrum for the team things. 

LEAN
The Lean Start-up. Eric Ries
He spent 6 months on a new feature for his website that he was proud of and no-one used it. So he’d wasted his time. And he created the Lean idea from that. 
It’s the hypothesis that if we create this,  will it be used? So you use a ‘measure’ technique - you put up a small part of it and if people do use it and click on it, then you can bother to build it. Pivot (stop and go onto something else) or persevere (there’s something in there that people like so press on with it)

Princes Triangle
Quality, Speed, Money on the three corners
i.e. you can only have two, everyone wants all three! 
If it’s fast and cheap it will be low quality
If its quick and high quality it will be expensive
If it’s … 

Why people stay in jobs. 
Salary plays a part, but not the main thing.  It’s more Autonomy (can i get on with things), Mastery (am I learning), purpose (do I have a sense of purpose, do I connect with the aims of the organisation). 

If your organisation doesn’t embrace failure as a learning experience. 

SYSTEMS THINKING - showing people things so they can alter decision. Rather than just telling employees ‘no, that’s a crazy idea’.
