Dr Sallyann Freudenberg - she has a talk on Vimeo on how developers think / those moments you feel stuck. 

POMODORO
There were 6 steps in original productivity technique. 
Timing your work for 25 minute bursts. 

RUBBER DUCK DEBUGGING
(maybe based on Ernie from Sesame Street who talks to his own rubber duck)
This is a technique. Talking it through with someone - it can be someone who knows nothing about what you’re doing. If you read the line of code out loud, you can see the faults. The very act of talking it through with someone, helps you see the way forward. 

STEP AWAY
If you’re feeling stuck (hitting a brick wall), walk away. Leave the computer and do something physically different for 5 minutes. 

5-SECOND RULE
Humans self-protect with all the ‘what if’ scenarios. There’s a video on the 5-second rule - google it - woman’s speech on this - how to stop your brain stopping you doing things.

IF YOU FEEL … 
… I have no idea how to solve this. 
Build on what you already know
- write down what you know already
- make a list of possible solutions - ‘opportunistic leaps’

IF YOU FEEL … 
… Where do i even start
Always break the problem down first. Get one scenario working first before moving on to what you see as the end result. 
Write the solution in pseudocode first - this means writing in English not in code i.e. it needs to do this thing and then it needs to do this thing. 

IF YOU’RE LOST, DON’T CODE 
Read through and write down what you need to do
Read through and write it down again
Write the solution in pseudocode
Only then think about what code to use

I TRIED … I FAILED
Extract information from failure
If the solution you tried didn’t work, write down what you learnt from that failing solution
Use what you learnt in order to inform your next attempt.
