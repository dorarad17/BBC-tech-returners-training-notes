PAIR PROGRAMMING

Solving problems together - one computer

The driver writes the code while the other is the navigator

The driver is the tactical one - worrying about the colons, or the braces,

The navigator has the bigger picture in mind. Important not to be a backseat driver - must keep the bigger picture in mind - don’t mention when there’s a colon missing or something, because your Pair will get to that and eventually notice themselves.

Software Engineering is 80% planning and questioning, 20% coding at the keyboard.
