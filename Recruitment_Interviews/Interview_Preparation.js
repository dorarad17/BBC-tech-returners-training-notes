Interview Preparation

Application - Beckie will look over our answers to the three qeustions they ask. The block answers. Not the rest of the application form, which should be fine. Don't worry too much about this - we won't be falling at the application hurdle. 

The Solo session
Drawing some architecture out? James will send over a whiteboarding video. 

The Pair Programming
It's more about explaining things through, listening, asking questions, interaction  with the partner. It's mord about that than completing it.
It's about the logical mindset, and how you talk things through. How you would take it going forward. 

Preparation for assessment day

Review notes from course
Review personal app
Review group app. 
Be confident about talking about all of that. they may ask you to talk around your code, why did you do this, why did you do that. 
They might ask things like 'the bbc has a searchbar, how do you think we do that?'Can talk through the issue. How many people use it? Lots of content. Talking out loud about the issues i.e. how users will be annoyed if search takes longer than a millisecond.
They are looking for abstract thinking, not so much the tech option. You're using it on every page of the site, so if you are using React, it makes sense for it to be a component, so you can re-use it. 
A question a bit like 'how many golf balls are there in an aeroplane' or 'why are there two escalators going up and only one going down'

Have you come across tech and do you know what problems it solves? 
Have you come across Relational Database Service (RDS) and what problem it solves. If you can't answer it, you could say can you tell me what field it is in and i'll see if I can relate it to something I have learnt. 

Involvement in tech community - meetups etc. 
personal prjects - things you want to do after the course
Passion and hearing that you care and that you really want to work for the organisation. 
How you keep up to date on tech topics etc. 
Follow poeple on bbc on twitter. Tech blogs that BBC have written themselves. 
Women in tech events. 

They're not looking to trip us up, they really want us to come at work at the BBC. They want to know what we have learnt and how to place them well at the BBC. 

Presentation - look at a page of the BBC website and talk about how you would change it. 
Gender balance and racial balance of images

1-2-1 Interview

Competency-based
BBC will have core competencies they need you to have. Maybe 6. Communication, innovation, leadershp, etc. 
"Tell me about a time you worked as a team"
"Follow the circle: your role (talk about yourself and what you achieved) the outcome, the challenges (but always reframe them as improvements and back them up with what you learnt and what was overcome)
Write down an example in advance that covers all of those - examples. You can take in notes with you - looks like you're prepared. 

Cultural questions
 - example questions from Beckie's 
 Challenge and achivements
 Looking for passion and commitment
 Communication is a skill - why do you believe that is one of your skills, give exact examples. 
 
 What are your devlopment areas? 
 You could answer i.e. Time management - using online apps to manage my time. 
 
 Perhaps an area of tech is my weakness - but doing online courses and going to meetups etc. So I'm working on that. 
 
 Where do you see yourself in 5 years time? If you can't answer that, you can answer soemrhing like "My priority at the moment is applying what I've learnt over last 15 weeks into a professional setting and continue learning. Then I'll work with my line manager to develop a development plan."
 
 Why do you want to work for us? Have a look at bbc website, things doing in community, have a look at their goals and use that to help you answer that question. 

Mind mapping
Graph gets you to think about key areas you will be asked about in interview
Your journey into coding: break down into bulletpoints. When your interest in coding started. Linking into story about how led into being here. Talk it thorugh. Alex and the Woodland app. Jonny. 

Projects and work experience

Solo project
Group project
work experience - shadowing
What were challenges, how we overcame them, how we delivered them. 

TOP SKILLS
Problem solving
Creative thinking
Logical thinking
communicaiton

Areas of development
Things you can improve

What's important to me? 
flexible working - can turn that into a question?
development - what development opportunites are there?
So you can ask the right questions that you need answering so you can decide whether to accept the job. 


PREPARE

Do some role playing, practising, in front of people I feel comfy with. 

The presentation
Go through

WHY have you done it?
HOW did you do it? 
WHAT impact did it have?


PREPARING FOR INTERVIEW:
Be project driven, set yourself deadlines and tasks. 
Do the same again, start a new React App
James will send us loads of KATAs on codewars, so keep those going on daily during the month wait. 
James has another project he can send us to do in the interim. Takes concepts with React, hook into another API, can focus on it and James will give feedback.

Jyoti asked: 
Just reading through the "Role Specific Capabilities" areas Sam mentioned we'll be asked about at assessment in his email today. Would you be able to explain what is meant by no 10. Domain Expertise in the first attachment? What exactly does domain mean in this context? 

On the Domain Expertise front
The BBC will know that you wont have BBC problem domain knowledge. EG. You won’t have knowledge of the specific tech they use or processes to ensure that people can vote during strictly. In the context of interview I would assume that they mean domain knowledge within the context of the course.
In practice, lets take DNS as example they would like to like to know that not only do you know what it is and how it works but also the reason it exists and why it has some of the features described in the course.
Or another example - React and specifically components, not only to know that they exist, how you write them but also why that logical construct of a “component” exists i.e. What problems it solves

I also sourced Sam’s thoughts on this and got the following to bits of detail for you:
===
Hi
That’s a better answer than I could offer!
I’ll have a go though......
The clue as to what we are after is described in the Capabilities - “Learning the general domain the team is focused on. Basic level of relevant technology understanding.”
This one is covered mostly within the “Technical Questions” part of the assessment - checking their level of “relevant technology understanding” that is we will ask them to questions about some of the technologies from the course why they exist and what they do or purpose is. In this context the domain is the information from the course and we are looking to see how well they have learned it.
The one bit that is possibly an extension will be related to “Understand test driven engineering approaches and their benefits.”
- this isn’t covered in the Technical Questions but is within the Programming Exercise.
We won’t be asking them to write any tests but will be looking for them to explain how they would apply TDD concepts to some code.
Thanks
Sam


Sam also followed up with:
===
Oh one more thing - for you to share.
There is a good set of “test” questions ob BBC Bitseize under KS3 found here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zts8d2p/revision/1
They might want to have a look at, no need to do the learnings for each section but the test questions give a bit of a clue as to how our questions *might* look - they are not on there as an FYI but the style is similar. (edited)

This was going to be our original interview at BC, so new online one may be a bit similar: 
Then on the day...
30 minute interview with at least 2 BBC engineers
30 minute presentation (15 mins duration, 15 mins Q and A) the candidates will be given topic prior to interview
90 mins - 2 technical exercises 
One paired with a BBC engineer
One alone based upon what they have covered in course
