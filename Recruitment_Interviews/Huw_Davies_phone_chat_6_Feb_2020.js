Huw Davies phone chat - 6 Feb 2020

I mentioned I wished I'd done some language learning before the course started, to have a stronger base, on which the new learning could be built. Huw mentioned this BBC initiative in schools:

In the job interview:

Focus on technical competence, on the journey I've had.

Know what you're good at. Against each of the Tech Returners learning themes, bullet point what I've been good at, what I've learnt, what challenges I've faced, verbalise what I have identified as my development areas. 

If I'm asked 'tell me about a time you've planned a project', better to talk about a project you've done as part of the course, rather than an art project. That keeps it relevant, as my prior experience might be good, but if I'm up against someone else who has experience of computer project planning, they will score higher. 

In theory, the BBC wants us all to go onto their Level 4 Software Developer Internships. Need to write where I'd like to be in future - focus in on what I am wanting. 

Different teams have different dynamics and different personalisities. Try to do some shadowing so I know which teams are which, so I can have a good fit. 

Some interviewees who don't have prior expeirence of interviewing at the BBC, just say 'I've done a CS degree', but they don't elaborate on what they've learnt, how they've applied the knowledge, what they are good at. 

You've got to 'salt and pepper' your interviews with actual stuff. Your core strengths, how you fit into the BBC's vision and aspirations and culture. Focus on your TECHNICAL COMPETENCE for the role you are applying for. 

What have you taken away from the course? 

Not in terms of competence - they know that we've only learnt 7 percent of what we need to know, but they want to hear about where we've been close to an uncomfortable place, how we solved the problems, when it was a issue, what languages we've learnt. Problem-solving aspect - bringing that into the conversation with an actual example - not generalise too much - hone in on technical stuff we've been doing. 

Be good to have an initial idea of where we want to be placed - whether want to be frontend or backend.
