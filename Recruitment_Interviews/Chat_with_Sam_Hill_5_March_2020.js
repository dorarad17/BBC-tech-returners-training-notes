Chat with Sam Hill - 5 March 2020

Thu 23 / Fri 24 April

2 of us start 9am
2 at 10am
2 at 1pm
2 at 2pm
both days

Inteview will be 2.5 hours

Will tell us if successful by following Wednesday hopefully, but probably not 

Four activities
* Interview for 1/2 hour - with software engineers
Questions are designed to ask us what we prefer and questions designed to ask us what we prefer wihtout us knowing that's what we're being asked.
* Presentation - prepare 4-5 slides beforehand and that is for us to apply our learnings to a problem and then present our thoughts. 15 minutes for presentation, 15 mins for questions

Two programming exercises
* One with a BBC engineer - this is an abstract one - how would you solve a problem - there are only one or two marks for getting working code and the rest is about how we would solve the problem
* One by ourselves (don't be scared, based on what been doing already)

Can you show us you have learnt from this course and show us you can continue to learn. Not designed to trip us up. We've spent 14 weeks learning how to be software engineers and show us what you've learnt. 

We all apply for one role - BBC careershub. 

Learning the principles of what engineering is about - how do you break something down, how do you w
Can you reapply that to a different problem. And if we can, we can probably work anywhere. 

We won't be asked questions like 'tell me about a time you failed'. Not looking at CV, have already got through HR process to get here, so won't need to do all that. 

We'll be interviewed by engineers. Questions could be like "tell us what an internet browser does when you try to open a browser". Panel will interview us - at least two people, probably three. They will ask us about our needs for flexible working and so on. 

NVQ something - the apprenticeship - equivalent to first/second year of a degree. 
Feedback from Manchester cohort was that they would have benefitted from staying together as a group longer and having more structured training. 

BBC's remit is to educate, inform, entertain and that applies to staff development too. They consider it part of their role to 

What are top rated skills at BBC. 

Communication is the top one. Part of that is active listening as well. Beyond that, it's being innovative, being able to come up with ideas, managing people in a constructive way. 

What other skills make someone happy or successful at the BBC? 

Good place to work. Everyone has heard of BBC. That level of outreach. Can make a change, graduates made changes to how login systems work. Already making differences to login systems. They have already contributed to that part of the BBC. That's what helps with happines.
Not profit driven. But there is fixed budget. But then have problems about how to scale up when don't have extra budget, so have to be extra creative. A commercial organisaton would just incrase the budget. But BBC can't do that. 
Get to work on some of biggest problems that exist. Another failure - iplayer stopped working on TV last night for half an hour and it crashed for half an hour. Due to numbers of poeple using it, and could scale up quickly enough. 
25/7 engineers - people who enjoy fixing things when they break. 

35 hour contract and do best to keep people to that. Go home. Don't use Slack and email overnight. 

10% time. A whole day a fortnight, where as a team they may do a training course. Or take the time to go and see something or do something that will feed in. 


James' thoughts

So knowing when to use a loop or to use a foreach or to use whatever ... that's the thing we need to show. Do you want to be booted out of arrays or not? 
Machines can check code. They can't check how you solve a problem.
