**Stories of a Bootcamp Graduate’s job hunt - Kaja Polkowska**

Did a bootcamp and finished, but had underestimated the work needed for the job hunting. These are the things I wish I knew:
I was EVERYWHERE
A few websites - Hired - can put your projects on, LinkedIn, CoderList, Reed, Unicorn Hunt, Indeed, AngelList, Slack - communities, meet-ups, Friends, Stack Overflow - have a careers part
Doing a lot of meet-ups to connect with people.
Really needed to work asap so applied for 80-90 jobs, not perfect ones, heard back from 10 and then had interviews and a few offers. So about a 10% strike rate.
Sort out your LinkedIn ASAP - send people your link - and get feedback. People really look at this early on in recruitment process.
Github - have a portfolio - your first bit of code and your first loop. Companies would like to look at this.
CV - keep it updated - visually interesting but clear layout and not too colourful. Put this on your GitHub too in a folder of docs.
Meetups - great place to meet people, about how they interview people, how they recruit.
Open source - so much info out there it can be overwhelming, but there is amazing info there. Also, contribute to threads and answer questions if you can. Somewhere someone will have accepted your code and used it, and you can put that on your CV.
Have your own Blog - if you can do this, great, get your ideas out there.
Companies could check out maybe ten years of your life for references - and it takes ages, even once you have accepted the job offer.
Have some questions ready for the interview. And if you’re not successful, ask for feedback so you can learn from it and improve.
PANEL: Do’s and don’ts of Junior Developer’s job hunting

**Victor Koleade (Talent Manager / recruiter) at JigsawXYZ**

Helped the company scale up from 40 staff to 75 staff.
CVs
When look at CV, he’ll spend 7 seconds looking at it, and if don’t see the bigger picture, it’ll go in the bin. How do you market yourself? I see 40 junior engineer CVs a day.
How does it look - if it’s all over the place, it goes in the bin.
Highlight / embolden the roles you have done, all the technology you’ve done and the tasks you’ve done. Make it visible what you have done.
You need to give enough meat on the bones of CV to interest him, even if you don’t have much info.
Highlight what you’ve done against what that person is looking for - tailor your CV to the job description of the new joiner.

DON’Ts FOR CVs

* Don’t include your personal data, your address, your DOB, your NI number, blood type …
* Make sure you check spelling and punctuation and layout. Make sure set to UK spelling. If you can’t pay attention to detail, you won’t be hired. Even someone with ten years experience won’t be interviewed if there are spelling mistakes on CV.
* Please don’t use more than one font.
* Make job titles stand out, so you can flick through, including your current training. Link to some work you’ve done.
* Don’t over design your CV. Keep It Simple Stupid. KISS.
* Don’t include your or any other pictures!

DO’s FOR CVs

* Do include your contact info
* Do make sure y our recent roles are in reverse chronological order. Most recent first
* Tailor your CV is relevant to the role you’re applying for
* Keep your CV neat and tidy and simple in layout
* With personal statement, use power words. Don’t use things such as “I helped, I assisted”. Instead, use “My achievements are … I launched … I supervise …” So you stand out.

Put examples of your work on GitHub, say how you trained. It’s okay to be a self-taught engineer, learn your trade, focus on your trade, make your portfolio, put things up that you’ve done. Honing and sharpening your skills.
Rather than say “I’m full stack”, which is probably unlikely after just a few months of training. Better to say that I’ve been doing front end but I’ve also done some back end and am interested in doing more. Or vice versa. Fine to say … “I don’t have enough experience at the moment to say which end I prefer, but I’m happy to jump in and get more experience and see where it takes me. ”

COVER LETTERS

It varies from company to company what they prefer. Sometimes I look at them and they are loooonnnngggg and off-putting. Let your CV do the talking, and at interview make sure you can back up what you have on your CV. Cover letters can just have a basic introduction and a couple of nice things about the company, to demonstrate you know about them and are interested in them.

INTERVIEW

Don’t be closed off at interview. Show your skills in a very emphatic way. Show passion at the interview but make sure you can back it up with evidence of how you realise your passion.
Don’t pester the hiring manager, don’t be calling, be cool …
Make sure you want to work for the company as much as they want you.

CULTURAL AND BEHAVIOURAL ELEMENTS

* Transferable skills

**Know where you are**
Have an interest in the company you’re applying for. You should be able to identify mission statements on website, do you identify with it, is it
**Passion** - look for passion in technology and coding - enthusiasm. In the tech test. You want the people with that passion and energy, improving yourselves.
**Confidence**
A balance between arrogance and competence. Highlight your achievements. Have the confidence to say you don’t understand but you are going to try your best and run with it
**Humility and empathy**
Easy to assess this in tech tests by watching how people work together. We bring juniors in for pair programming with each other. Can see how people work with each other. If you’re the stronger one, are you going to just put your head down and finish the test. Or are you going to bring your team mate along with you and let them be in the driving seat and empathise and help them to learn and do it together.
Being a good listener, listening to your pair or a mentor. Listen, acknowledge, respond.
**Enthusiasm**
For the job. To share knowledge. Your passion and interest and willingness to work hard to learn more.
**Planning and organisation**
Having goals, what do you want to be doing in 3 months, 6 months, a year, 5 years? On a happy path, where do you see yourself?

TECHNICAL ELEMENTS

What technical level we’d expect junior engineers to be reaching
**Javascript Primitives**
	* String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, **Symbol**
	* Everything else is an object.
**How you might declare your variables**
	* var, let, const
	* All within a function or a block scope
**Functions**
	* Function declaration - function get name
	* Function Expression
**Object Manipulation**
	* loops
	* forEach
	* map
	* reduce
	* filter
	* sums
**Conditionals**
	* if/else
	* case/switch
**Operators**
		* ==
		* ===
		* <
		* >
		* !
		* ?
	* Ternary: condition ? truthy : false
**Asynchronous behaviour**
	* Callbacks - a function you can pass into a function that executes after another function
	* Promise Chains - a promise is an object, the three states, pending, fulfilled, rejected, where is it going to go
	* Async/Await - a tidier way of dealing with ???

TECHNICAL - ADVANCED

* Cloning objects - shadow clone versus deep clone
* Frameworks
		- nodeJS/NPM
		- React
* Testing
		-  Unit
		- component/integration/End to end (be aware of these)
* Swagger/openAPI - for documentations purposes
* Design  Patterns
* DRY
* Single Responsibility Principles
* API / RESTful interfaces


CHOOSING THE RIGHT COMPANY

* Identify the company
* What do you want to get out of it
* Take a risk to work at the company you want to be with, that chimes with you


Q&A

**What are your tech tests like?**
The tech tests are small projects. Javascript. Node JS, Express.js
There’s an end goal but it depends how you get there.
Getting the functions to do what you want them to is good.
Ideally, you’d also use Jest to test it. If not, you can talk through it … “I haven’t written the test yet, but this is how a test could work … ”
Want to see how you’re working through the problem, when you’re coming in for the junior role.

**What’s a typical day like for you?**
Day to day, might have a stand-up, then crack on with the code, helping people, features, bugs, ticket based. Decide what to spend next two weeks on - sprint - planning and looking back at the end.
Building code that’s easy to change,
Building code that’s easy to test
Sometimes it’s changing infrastructure and sometimes it’s changing code.

**What’s the most interesting problem you recently solved?**
Good question.

**How do you recommend learning?**
Codewars, get the logical practice going on.
Everybody learns differently - some from books, tutorials, but actually doing it is the main thing.
Make something, break it, learn, carry on.

Benefit to future of tech - more progressive, openminded and constructive
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. (edited)
