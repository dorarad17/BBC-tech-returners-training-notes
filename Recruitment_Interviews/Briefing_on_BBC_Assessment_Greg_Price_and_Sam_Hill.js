Briefing on BBC Assessment - Greg Price and Sam Hill - 23 Jan 2020

Greg is Resources Manager for D+E

Greg and Sam are involved in process of creating the course, applying for roles and assessment process for bringing people into roles at BBC. 

Q.  Starting salary?
£24000 plus London weighting = £28,682
All staff at BBC get an August pay increment every year. We may get it too this year, depending on start date. 
As you progress up through levels, your salary increases. 
We join at Associate level within band B. They’d like us to move up to band C, which is Junior level within 6-12 months. 

There are job-specific pay bands within each of the main pay bands. 
Junior level has a wide range from Junior and beyond. 
Band C is about £25-40k plus London weighting on top. 
Also a BBC benefits package - 25 days annual leave, flexible packages where we can buy/sell benefits i.e. buy an extra week of annual leave per year, 35 hour week

Q. Start date?
Can start as soon as the course completes. 
We’ll do our final presentations, then they will send out dates for the mini assessment day. That could be within a fortnight and for the previous cohort, job offers were made two days after that.  Once you’ve got your offer, you could start the next day in theory. But realistically, it takes a couple of weeks to start from getting your offer - there’s a process of reviewing and signing  contract, send back, getting passes started. 

We will get a continuing employment contract, not a fixed term contract. There is a six-month probation period, before the job becomes permanent. 

Within the last cohort, 14 passed the assessment day and 12 took up the job offers. 

We will need to apply for the jobs. 
It will be a CareersHub application process
It will be straightforward - a CV and application form. On application form, we’ll be asked to demonstrate our learning, everything we have covered in the course and how we can bring that to bear on Associate Software Developer vacancy. 

Q. What is the assessment? 
It’s not a competency based assessment. There will be an interview to discuss some technical issues. 
There will be two programme-ey type exercises. One on paper and one on laptop. No right and wrong answers, more about how would you go about solving it. 

It’s not an exam where they test knowledge and recall, but it’s about articulating concepts and ideas and reasoning and talking things through. Doesn’t matter if we don’t get something working as long as they can see the logic of our thinking. 

It could be Pair Programming - working with experienced assessors or team leaders from the BBC. 

During this process, they will be trying to judge where best to put us, where we will have the greatest chance of success. 

James says, It’s a ‘filtering in’ process not a ‘filtering out’ process. We just need to show that we’ve learnt from the course. It’s an enjoyable day too. Opportunity to network with developers from different teams. 

Some of it is an extrapolation forward of the things we have studied. Show them we have learnt from the course, show them that we can learn.

There’s no right answers to the exercises. It’s temperature gauge to our ability. 

They will be asking us preferences as to which team we might want to work in - but we don’t need to state a preference.  Front end / back end / full stack. Say what you’ve enjoyed, what you have got the most from and they will see what they can do. 

For the practical exercises, there won’t be time to consult notes. But you can bring notes to exercises and to the the interview if you like. 

Try to describe your learning journey. Huw can set up phone practice interviews for us before the actual interviews to help us structure our answers, rather than rambling on. 

Q Is this applying for being placed within a team? Yes, you are placed within one team and you would stay there initially.  
After the 6-month probationary period, you can then apply for roles internally as you see fit. Regular conversations with line manager will facilitate this etc. 

BBC welcomes flexible working and part-time working. If you have a flexible working need, just state your needs on the application form. 

They offer further training and apprenticeship style training throughout career and are especially intending to do that for us. 

James says … 

BBC will be testing our logical reasoning - we can look online at what that means. 

The assessment might be looking at code and seeing how it could be made better. 

They might give you some code and ask you what the code is doing, what the purpose of the code is and how you might improve it. They might ask you how you would critique the code. 

Further reading - fundamentals such as functions, loops etc, applies across all the languages. So if we were to see some python, would we be able to understand what it is. 

Demonstrate enjoyment of problem solving.
