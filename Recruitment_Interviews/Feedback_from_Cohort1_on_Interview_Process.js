Feedback from Cohort1 on Interview Process

Emma Stockton
Hello! I was also in BBC Cohort 1, so I’m happy to answer any questions you have about the process!
The advice I would give is to trust that you have learnt more than enough to begin your career in tech. The interviewers are there to help you, they want you to be successful too! If they ask questions you don’t know, it’s probably that they’re just pushing your knowledge to see how great you are, not to catch you out.

Thank you for your reply Emma! Congrats on your success at BBC. What do you wish you knew before you started work at BBC?

Emma Stockton 
That’s a tough question! I think I would have liked to have known that I wasn’t expected to know about everything. It took me a long time to be confident in speaking up and saying that I didn’t know what people were talking about. Most of the time, I wasn’t the only person who needed clarification, so I’m pleased I’ve started doing that!

Emma Stockton 
Thinking back to how I felt when I first started, I can’t believe how far I’ve come. I’m so much more confident in asking for help and knowing where to look to find answers by myself. I’m definitely so so pleased I got a job here 

Emma Stockton 
Do you know when your interview is going to be?

Jyoti Sharma 
That's really helpful and they must have listened to all your feedback because I think they have definitely made that clear to us this time around. Don't have a definite date for assessment yet but our presentation is on 19th March so shortly after that I guess.

Emma Stockton
We definitely provided a lot of feedback around the interview process as well as the onboarding, so I hope it’s a bit smoother for you! Good luck with your presentation too! If you do have any more questions about anything that I might be able to help with, I’m more than happy to answer them!

Hi @Ruth Nassar! Thanks for answering, it's great to hear more from the first cohort! 
They've told us that the interview will have three parts - a panel interview, a paper-based programming exercise, and a laptop-based programming exercise.
Was yours the same format? What sort of things did they ask in the panel interview? I'm feeling pretty nervous about it because I've never done any sort of tech-y interviews before! I know they don't expect us to know everything, but can't shake the feeling that I'm just not going to know enough!

It sounds like a very similar format! I honestly can’t remember the questions they asked, seems like a long time ago! From what I do remember, they were questions to check your general understanding of what you’d learned on the course. One thing you could do is check out Medium eg. https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering
There might be some articles there relevant to things going on in the BBC at the moment.
We had to do a presentation and these sorts of articles were very useful in preparing! I think if you can show an awareness of something eg accessibility, security...that’s probably  what they are looking for, not in depth knowledge.

Hi all 
I’m Sara and I was part of Cohort 3 (March 2019) and now work at ANS as a Web Developer. I wanted to add my experience to the conversation regarding interviewing/looking for jobs after the course, hoping to share some information and some useful tips 
In my case, the cohort was being sponsored by 3 companies and we had the opportunity to apply for positions with all 3 of them, which I did. Even though I had my preference, I wanted to also have some experience of interviewing in the tech field, and I really suggest to everyone to approach interviews this way. Interviewing is a process in itself, and something that you get better at with experience. If you’re interviewing with a Techreturners sponsor, bear in mind that those companies are fully aware of your course, what you’ve learned and what they can expect from you. 

In terms of preparing for a code test, there are so many online resources for that. I mainly used Daily Coding Problem (https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/), as well as Youtube and resources from Techreturners. If you don’t know where to start or are a bit overwhelmed by researching exercises and platforms, I would use the homework you’ve completed during the course and try to explain your problem solving strategy out loud. This really helped me breaking down the logic and understanding my own though process even better. Interviewing is tough, but always remember how far you’ve come since the start of the course and look how much you’ve achieved in such little time.
Good luck to anyone who is preparing for interviews

Echoing a bit of what Ruth and Emma said! I definitely wish I’d practised some more coding exercises prior to doing the assessment; and feel free to ask questions as you go along. There was a few times that I definitely asked for clarification of things. I was sooo nervous before mine but it obviously went a bit better than I thought it did! I think they may be changing the interview process slightly since we did them based on some of our/the interviewers feedback.

@Jyoti Sharma I’ve no idea if your interview will be the same as ours, but for the technical part I found it useful to practise the sort of short exercises you find on CodeWars/Exercism/FreeCodeCamp. I’d also say they are not just looking at your technical knowledge but how you approach trying to solve a problem. Make sure you read any instructions carefully...if it says you can ask for help, then ask for it if you need it! Don’t be afraid to ask them to repeat any questions if they didn’t make sense the first time! Good luck, please ask if there’s anything else you want to know. The process felt daunting at the time, but the interviewers were lovely, as Emma says they want you to do well.
