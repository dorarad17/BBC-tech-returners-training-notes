For anyone interested in learning a bit more about SQL and databases there is also a Codeacademy course
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql
I've not done that one before so if anyone has and has feedback it would be good to hear how it went (edited) 

Sam:
If you really want to understand SQL and MySQL thoroughly I did three hours of this four hour course (stopping when it went beyond what we're doing) https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY The instructor populates the tables with data from Dunder Mifflin. As a US Office fan I found it actually helped me understand things better!
NB: Beware when it comes to setup. He has a dedicated SQL IDE - what you have already is fine - just spin up MySQL, navigate to your databases and code along! (edited)

Also following up from the completion of React app can everyone also please signup for an AWS account
https://aws.amazon.com
Then top right hand corner click the button that says Create an AWS account
The signup process will ask you for a bank card but everything we create during the course will be under the free tier
If you already have an AWS account then we can use an existing account
We do make use of your AWS account tomorrow for the class so please try and have your account created ready for the session (edited)

Great website for picking colours. All you do is click on the colour and it gives you the # code to copy https://colorhunt.co/palette/158271 (edited)


JAMES: 
As well as the above, previous cohorts have also followed through this tutorial website for learning React:
https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact 

Alex Nicolaides  
For those of you who don't know, there's a React Dev Tools extension for chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en


James
One tip on this is to use the library called moment
https://momentjs.com/
When working with dates generally you'll want to use some form of library

Alex:
codesandbox.io is also a pretty cool place to do stuff, it has a built in react dev tools but apparently it can be a bit buggy

Sam:
I've only done some of the exercises before, but I can highly recommend this as a fun, low-pressure code-along in vanilla Javascript if out-of-context exercises start getting to you over the holidays! All free and forkable from Github https://javascript30.com/

James:
Prior to starting the lesson could everyone watch this video please (4m 32s)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3AkSS5hXMA
It gives a bit of background about what React is and some of its terms

Sam:
Pay what you want on O'Reilly Books (the 75p tier includes '97 Things Every Programmer Should Know' and 'Javascript: The Good Parts'! https://www.humblebundle.com/books/oreilly-classics-oreilly-books?hmb_source=navbar&hmb_medium=product_tile&hmb_campaign=tile_index_6

Sam:
Right you gorgeous lot: lots of you wanted to go deeper into computer science principles and I wanted to share some resources if, like me, you learn best from media other than books. First up, CS50 - Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science course. The first term is free on edX and exercises are in C (really makes you appreciate higher-level languages if you've been having a hard time with them). Right now I wouldn't recommend diving that deep, so the immensely accessible lectures are available here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382eX9-tF75Wa4lmlC7sxNDH
If you've heard of the Code Newbie podcast, the host of that does a lovely conversational two-person show about basic CS principles here: https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs Each episode builds on the last, so make sure you start at the beginning.

For anyone who wants to procrastinate in a constructive way, I've never been to a conference where talks were so relevant to me in my situation.

Have you come across the moment library?

And this is a little code example

Hi @James, do I remember you saying that if we wanted to work on building another project over the next few weeks you had a brief/suggestion of other things we could make?
I want to keep busy building something else but inspiration isn't striking atm, haha

Hi @Rosie Inman
I did mention this - we have the "Reading Returners" project
Let me grab you the brief

@James I've tried to deploy our app to git pages, but its only deployed the read me. What have i done wrong ? (edited) 

James  18:06
Have you used gh-pages to deploy? 
If not then you'll need to use that - I'll grab you a link

Charlotte  18:07
I did it from github

For react apps it's slightly different

@James For those of us generating IDs in the backend, I see you removed UUID as a dependency from package.json, but it still exists in package-lock.json. Should we be removing all traces of it?
Answer: No only remove it from package.json - the package-lock.json is managed by npm install so if you run npm install it should in turn remve it from package-lock file

Anyone who hasn't heard of https://www.notion.so/ it's a great note taking website that allows you to create your own wiki type thing!

We are immediately introduced to a website that gives a numerical representation of each character on the average keyboard; the importance being that it is really the best way to ensure cross-browser and cross-language compatibility for the app.

I’ve just listened to this - https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/how-to-fail-with-elizabeth-day/id1407451189?i=1000470060728 and found it very thought provoking and strangely comforting.
