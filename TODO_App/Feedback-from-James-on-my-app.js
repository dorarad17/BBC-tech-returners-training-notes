Feedback from James on my todo app

Hi Rebecca
Looking through your frontend react app now

Just completed reviewing your todo app!
Really great work! The app captures everything taught on the course
Code is well formatted and I can follow your logic
Problem solving can be seen throughout your code such as utilising different JS functions such as filter 
Great understanding of fundamentals - You have utilised conditionals, loops and objects demonstrate that well
README has been completed and updated also 
Having discussion about code optimisation (trimming down the bloat) tells me that your level of understanding is there and already at a stage of looking for improvements 
Thats it all done :white_tick:
