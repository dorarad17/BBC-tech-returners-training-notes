Lightning Talk - Shilpa Danwe - 12 Dec 2019

Principal Software Engineer D+E
Volunteers with Women in Stem at BBC

Career Break = brought up child. 

Went for management post - to manage a project

GO after what you want, you will have it
ASK for help - there are no silly questions - everyone learns from everything. 
Be proactive and step forward - prioritise your ideas and take them forward. 
You do not need to know ALL the answers to start

There are some days that you think you have got it and sometimes you realise actually you haven’t, you need to go back and try again. It’s all part of learning and will happen throughout your career. 

WORKING AT BBC - still loving it! 

- Inclusive
- Flexible, remote working.  Family friendly. 
- Numerous career opportunities. Short and long term secondments.  Has moved from Engineer, to Team Lead to Principal Engineer. 
- BBC - Women in STEM network (wistem@bbc.co.uk)
