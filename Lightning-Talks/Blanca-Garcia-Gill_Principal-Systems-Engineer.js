Lightning talk - Blanca Garcia Gill - Principal Systems Engineer (BBC encouraging development)

Software Engineering 
women in tech - been always the only one in her team - until joined the BBC.. Very refreshing to work with women
Conversations about boundaries. Inevitable to compare yourself to others, every company talking about rockstar programmers. I have self doubt and criticism in my head. 
But at BBC there are women and men who push me forward and encourage me. 
Colleagues who say ‘push yourself forward and apply for a new job - the leaps you want to take’. Don’t compare yourself to everyone else, get a cheerleading network around you of men and women, and of different generations - and they will have eyes and ears in rooms that you don’t have access to. 
Her job is a lot more than coding. Spending time mentoring, speaking at conferences, part of women in Stem network at BBC. 
Coding is only the start of things, only coding by yourself is not going to change the world. You want to be part of a group that has power to do things together. And discuss ideas with people and convince them. 
Be a bit careful who you voice your dreams to, because people can say things that don’t encourage like ‘oh, you’re aiming high’. 
Women working in Tech at BBC, there’s a Women In STEM mentoring meet up group - lunchtime once a month. Meeting female engineers in other teams. There’s a topic and then you chat and began helping me to see beyond my team and beyond the role of the engineer. And I got a mentor, and she has helped me take steps forward. Kicked me up the butt!
Since I began talking at conferences, I have more confidence and the team puts me on a pedestal a bit as an expert. I’m not interrupted in meetings anymore, I am listened to. 
Some men who are empathetic can be treated as women and other underrepresented groups and interrupted and so on. 
When people who are quiet, express themselves and share their ideas, that is a good sign of a well functioning team. I used to behave like an alpha male, as I was so used to being the only women on my team, so I had t unlearn that aggressive behaviour when I joined the BBC.
Audience platform - collection of data reliably and making sure they are serving audiences across the UK, what people click on, what they favourite. Systems often break - I like looking at why they break and how to fix them. 
Just take small steps with your learning - what is your next step - and slowly you will improve one bit at a time. It adds up to more than you think.
