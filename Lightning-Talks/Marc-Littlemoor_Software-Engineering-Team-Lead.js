Will answer all emails - don’t worry about bothering me - really happy to talk to anyone. 

THE EARLY YEARS
Conventional route into technology - as a child - basic programming for Atari CVS. First introduction to programming - 8/10 year old
ZX Spectrum
Commodore 64
Degree in computer science. 
Videogame industry for 19 years - worked for Ocean and ultimately for Sony. Worked on PlayStation games. X-men Games, shooting games, Walking Dead games, Wipeout. but games programmers have long hours and unpaid overtime. Doesn’t fit with family and kids. 

You’ve got to love what you do.  Do brilliant things, not at the expense of happiness. 

Joined the BBC. I love the BBC - still do. Proud of how they educate children. Grew up with it. 

Worked on APIs, how we integrate two classes and things like that. Things that give data. 
First time learning NodeJS and JS and React. AWS. All these technologies opened up to me. 

EMBRACE CHANGE  in software development things are always changing - you just have to learn whatever is thrown at you - and then you’ll do really well. 

Sign in, registration, personal data, GDPR, make sign-in process easier, gateway to it all. 

You have to sign in to vote, support Strictly Come Dancing, how much traffic normally get - 17 times number of people singing in within 30 seconds , than normally get signing-in, so system has to cope with that. 

FAQ

Which language? 
It doesn’t matter. Use whichever you enjoy. BBC will teach you other ones you need to use. You’ll be looking at C, Python, R, they are all pretty similar once you know one. 

How do I get better / how do I learn? 
Practice. Alway be learning. Do little projects. Make it useful for you to set a deadline. Use Trello. 
Something that’s useful to you and means something to you. In a week I’m going to create this web app, this webpage. And you’ll dig deep into it. 

I’m not very good!
Neither am I. Everyone gets Imposter Syndrome. I’m a team leader at BBC and I wake up in the morning and think I’m not good enough. Everyone gets imposter syndrome. Sometimes you smash it, sometimes you’re completely lost. That’s fine. 
Solutions are ‘go to bed’, ‘rubber ducking’, ‘teach someone else’, shower thoughts. 

What to learn? 
Write maintainable code
Read maintainable code - go onto GitHub, read your friend’s code and by reading that, you’ll learn more. 
Write something, pare it down, write code using the least amount of code the better. 
Choose your language (and stick with it for a while). Once you understand the basic logic, you can pick up other language’s easily. 
You must learn how to use version control. You make mistakes and it doesn’t matter. Just roll back to an earlier version. 
Communication around code / code reviews / pair programming (talking around code really helps learning) / explain your thinking. 
Fail often - it doesn’t matter if you fail. Failing is learning, don’t be afraid. Even senior people on team can spend days trying to work a problem out. But try new ways and do it

BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
YOU’VE GOT THIS! 
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT

BBC is great, part of reason here is the educational reason. CBeebies. CBBC. I’ve personally gone from where I felt like an expert (game design), and then joined BBC and didn’t know lots of things and BBC said ‘we’ll send you on a course for that’, let us teach you, all senior developers are there to hold your hand and help you learn.  You get to learn new things all the time at the BBC. 
If you don’t understand, put your hand up. Ask amazing questions. 

BBC can’t be a monopoly so a lot of games are outsourced.
