Been working on Forecaster 5G web app
- split the program into multiple objects. 
- To be delivered for 5G
Deliver some objects via multicast and some objects via unicast
The objects are composed ‘optimally’ on the device as per the users choices, e.g. sign-language presenter instead of verbal one

Anything which is personal has to be unicast, just send it to the unique user, not the same thing for every user!

Other types of optimisation:
A half hour radio programme but if you only have 20 mins to listen, it will edit less critical stuff out
Cooking show and you input how many rings your hob has and what ingredients you have in the fridge and the show would customise what you watched.
