SHOBA's journey:

Not from tech background, started as a banker, international fund transfer units, and she was expert who had been using old banking systems and then migrated to new internet system and would test those to make sure they met user expectations and then go back to dev team. Then slowly understood what was being offered. This testing became more fun than doing normal job. 
So doing lots of testing of other banking software. And then decided to be the person helping to develop things earlier on in the process. 

What are passionate about:  
- if something passes thorugh me, it should be perfect and the customer should be happy. When it's handed over, customer has best product they require
- it's not a routine job, every app is different, there are always new things to learn, learn new tools all the time

Why is software testing important for you? 
- you give a really good user experience, if somethng breaks, you don't have good systems. Transaction experience failures can be very expensive if things don't work in companies. But at the BBC, trying to build trust and reliability with the public. Although cost is a big thing, and if there are problems with live issues, lots of people will have to work on it quickly and it will be very expensive. But if you find the fault in testing, it's very much cheaper for the company. 
- You need to be sure whatever you build first is working, before you build the second thing on top, and then the third thing. Each stage has to be tested. 

What is Test Automation? 
Scaling up, when it's an enormous build, you need to automate it, you can't test all that manually. Have to be sure every

How have you mentored people new to testing in the team? 
First thing, we make sure person is comfortable with the five products they work on. 
Work mostly in Java and increasingly JS.
Pairing at first with more experienced team member. 
Then give small tasks to them and do testing and come out with findings. then analyse that in terms of what was good, what they missed, what are best practice tests.
