Joined over 3 years ago, R&D grad scheme, 2016-18, 3 projects, 8 months each, London and Salford

Made good engineer as had wide diversity of projects to work on. 

It’s the fields you can apply it to that makes it interesting.

Q&A

It’s shocking when you first join a team and you don’t know the language they use. Take the time to look at their repository and dissect the code and learn by building things and then it all comes together. 

The machine learning one was probably the most frustrating to learn, it’s a kind of black box, you can add another layer but you are never going to understand how the thing works. 

C++ is probably most challenging to learn as it’s strongly typed. C++ is fast so many video games are made in that language. It was chosen but other languages could have been chosen. Web Assembly is written in C++

Web Assembly sits on top of lots of languages and can then be read by any device. It’s a really promising technology. It works with JS, so you can drop a blob of Web Assembly into your javascript, so you can have a bit of C++ in your browser that runs things at that speed.
