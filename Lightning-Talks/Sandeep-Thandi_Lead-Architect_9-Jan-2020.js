Work with Platform team a bit
Audience needs are changing, technology is changing. 
Went into computers at aged 18, with the idea of heading towards being a Project Manager. 
Started as Lotus Notes developer for Norwich Union healthcare company.
Enjoy most the problem solving element of technology. Prefer analytical thinking more than the coding side of it. 
Other skills that are important in technology. 
Then worked for ITV - all about getting content out onto channel. 
Making sure that software is actually doing what people need it to do. How are people feeling, how does it meet their needs, how are we making their lives better. 
Then worked for utility company, British Gas, looking at how people in call centre are using their screens, and what they need to have in front of them to assist the customers. 
Went to see people using the software in the call centre, and realised that the software wasn’t working well. Now I try to make sure I’m doing the right thing for the right reasons, not just to get the project out of the door. 

Design Thinking
Interesting methodology - look it up. Quite a cool way of thinking about problem solving. 
Don’t want to miss out the stage called empathy - what is the actual problem the user is having - they ask for a chair, you give them a chair, but understand first what they actually need, as a chair might not be the best solution. 
Helps you to ask the right questions and be sure they are solving the right problem. Can use technology to solve anything, but doesn’t mean we are solving it in the right way or for the right reason. 

Work with people who are very technical, with engineering backgrounds, who like to code for fun, lots of technology language. But when we bring in some of user concepts into what we are doing, it challenges things just being about solving a problem, but is it making things better. 

It’s a really exciting time to be in technology industry. 

An Architect is someone who tends to look slightly further out - what are capabilities of the organisation - what are the things we already have - and how can we achieve what we need to. 

Architects try to set vision for the world needs to look like in the future so are prepared for the changes. And look at things like machine learning and how that might impact the organisation in the future.
