James says:

Here is the next serverless webinar - this time it's connecting your serverless backend to the database.
In the video, I also show my database tables and structure as well as a complete backend API ready for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE

Your third webinar on Serverless is below.

This video outlines how to utilise external configuration in your backend API.

It also shows solutions for last weeks homework.

Your final webinar on Serverless is below.

This video outlines the steps involved in order to CREATE tasks such that your code will perform INSERT's into your MySQL database.

Webinars
In the video, I go through the code required in order to add tasks (via your API) to your database.

The video also shows further usage of Postman for hitting your API, this time as a POST method.

It is 35 mins long and includes realtime googling as I try to work out how to solve it.
