REST - representational state transfer

How you structure data into a manageable format. 

You’ve got data in your database and you want to have a way people can interact with that data. 
Your database is secure, but not massively so. 
You can open up your database and give people limited access. 
You would still make an API for your backend so you can use any technology you like on the frontend. 

REST is a set of rules for the gateway between frontend and backend. So when the user adds a task, the rules by which that is added to the backend database, REST are those rules. 

If you have a school. 
You might have API endpoints, such as a school will have classrooms, students that are in that classroom. 

i.e. 
www.someapi.com/schools/6/classroom/3/student/26
Would give you info about student 26 in class no 3 within school no 6. 

someapi.com/tasks/jfskldf/ksadjfskl
The URL gives you the relationship between things. 

Don’t use Wikipedia - too much jargon - use something like codecademy, that explains things from a teaching perspective.
