For tonight if you get a moment, could you install two separate pieces of software please?
Serverless
We use this to deploy your backend API functions.
The first one is called serverless  and you install it by doing this:
npm install -g serverless
If the above doesn't work then try:
sudo npm install -g serverless
Postman
We use this to test your API functions
https://www.getpostman.com/ and click on Download the App (NOTE: You do not have to pay or register so you should be able to avoid entering any form of payment details!) (edited)

I found this really helpful in terms of API terminology
