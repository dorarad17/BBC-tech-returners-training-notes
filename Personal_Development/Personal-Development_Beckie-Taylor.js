PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT

Beckie Taylor

What does success look like to me? 
What is my path to get there? 

CV - list your tech skills, but also your transferable skills and personal skills. How they can be relevant. 

Social profiles - LinkedIn

Where are you now? - such as achievements or skills
- your journey
- what does success look like to you - such as what do you want?

Pause and reflect about what you’ve done each week. On the journey we’re going to go on. Keep notes each week about what you struggled with, what you liked, what you liked less, what you’ve learnt that week.
