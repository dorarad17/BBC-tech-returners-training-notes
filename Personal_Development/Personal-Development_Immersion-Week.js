Understanding your own unique strengths
Be true to yourself and list yourself as you are. This is who I am. I want to be me. What are my key strengths and embrace them. And learn how to utilise them in different circumstances. 
Luminous flash. 
They want to box you in. i.e. you’re an introvert or an extrovert. And it’s bollocks, you can be both in different situations. 
Beckie going to send out a link to this ring and tells you a bit about your own natural strengths. 
Outcome focused or empathetic/people-focused. Will help us  in pair programming - learning how to get the best of situations, rather than clash. 
How can I adapt my communication style to get the best out of this situation. 
It will help us to get our natural strengths and prepare for the BBC interviews. 

WINS FROM IMMERSION WEEK 
I’ve had a fun, restful week, being out of my normal life of trying to do so many things - be an artist, caring for my elderly parents, looking after kids. Not having to do the everyday labour of ‘have you got your PE kit, what time is the childminder coming, what’s for tea’. Sitting down and drinking a hot cup of tea. I never get to drink my tea hot. 
Meeting new people and being part of this lovely group of women, some from different parts of the world and different backgrounds. 
Getting a BBC staff pass and striding into the building like I belong. 
Feeling fine about not knowing things - that it’s been framed as my job now. 

REMEMBER YOUR MOTIVATION - why are you here? 
HAVE FUN
Something that satisfies me
I want a different life
I want to prove I can do it
