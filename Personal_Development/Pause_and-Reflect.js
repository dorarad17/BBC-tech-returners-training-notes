Pause and reflect 

about what you’ve done each week. On the journey we’re going to go on. Keep notes each week about what you struggled with, what you liked, what you liked less, what you’ve learnt that week. 

DURING THE IMMERSION WEEK

I struggled a bit with pair programming as I know so little, I felt like I needed to enter my own world a bit and focus down on it with a clear head. I think the Pair Programming was a quicker way of getting the task done, but I’m not sure it was a quicker way of learning. We often stumbled upon the answer without understanding why it worked. 
I’m pleased to think that I’m at peace with not knowing much. 

AFTER THE IMMERSION WEEK 

This has been a bit of a downer. I was full of confidence after the Immersion Week, but then when it came to do the homework, I realised that I actually know Jack Shit! 
I understand the maths logic of it and I have no problem thinking through what is needed in pseudocode. But when it comes to writing it in JS, my mind vibrates and I somehow get white noise in my head and I can’t see the wood for the trees. Ho hum. I ended up just writing the answers in pseudocode and committing those. 

AFTER WEEK TWO

All very simple to understand. Very easy homework for me, having already used HTML on our own website over the years. Designing the App on paper, thinking through dynamic problems, laying it out in HTML. Simple. Did this in a few hours. Then have rest of homework time to relook at JS. 

AFTER WEEK THREE



AFTER WEEK FOUR

it’s such a privilege to be taught this stuff. It’s so much easier to understand, when it’s being filtered by James to decide what we need to know.  I feel pretty good about this. When I look at my html sheet and I can decode it and understand it and make changes to it. And use terminal. And GitHub. It’s all brilliant. 

I do still have in the back of my mind that  I am still less than mediocre at JavaScript and I need to get onto that over the Xmas holidays.  An hour or so a day at least. 

AFTER WEEK FIVE

Christmas holidays! 
Already 31 December. Have listened and absorbed James’ webinars on React. Now I just need to pluck up the courage to begin working on taking my html todo list into React. 
I still feel quite confident. It’s a process and I am in the middle of it. I do think this frontend stuff is easier for me. Than perhaps I’m going to find the backend stuff.
