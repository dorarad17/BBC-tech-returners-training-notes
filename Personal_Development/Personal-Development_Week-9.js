Beckie - Week 9

What would BBC expect from us in the first 3 months?
All the companies TR deal with know what we’ve done on the course and understand what has been learnt over the 15 weeks. So the end of the course is the start of our journey. Rest assured that the BBC know about us - they have a buddy and a mentor. Watch them coding, be with them on stand-ups, you might not hit a key for first 2 month. Need to understand a lot, you’re more like a sponge trying to pick things up. 

How do we cope going from learning environment to job environment?
It is going to be overwhelming and lots of information and that’s normal. 
Reflect on how far you’ve come, make a journal entry at the end of each day. Focus on the successes. 
Ask questions - there is no stupid question. That is how you learn. 
We’ve also got each other and can have lunch, meet after work, and support each other. 
There’s BBC womens’ network and STEM network. So build connections. Every person we’ve had lightning talks with, reach other to those people as they have all given their contact details. 
Jess and Lydia can also be reached out too. 
Reach back out to the previous cohort in Manchester. The journey and how they felt. They’ve been in our position. 
There’s a lot of support. 
See it as an amazing opportunity rather than as a worrying thing. 

What sort of jobs are there outside the BBC? 
Lots of junior jobs

Beckie will send out a CV webinar around formats, a template to adapt. There’ll be one-on-one support over the next few weeks 
CVs and interview prep in more details during project kick-off session. 
And Beckie will be at one of he project week sessions. 
At the end of the course, we’ll have a tech-focused CV to submit to the BBC. 
At the end we’ll go through interview prep. 
Some tools to help us mind-map questions, i.e. tell me about a time you’ve done XYZ? How to answer those questions under pressure. Dos and Don’ts for interviews. 

Job description Jargon. 
Find some and send them to Beckie and James and they can do a jargon-busting session. 

Why now? Why coding now? What’s brought you to this place? Recall your own journey in a succinct way. 

You look at how something has been done and take that concept and logically apply some parts of that to my problem.

Always keep an evidence log of things you’ve achieved and the value you have added to the conversation, and then you have the evidence behind you of having a salary review. 
Role play the conversation and take out emotion - just deliver the facts. 
Let there be silences and let them reply. 
If you’re in those conversations and you believe you’re worth more and you get knocked back, that’s not the right organisation for you.  I handed my notice in and my boss started crying, but he’d left it too late to value me. 

Go onto Rag Dog and list all your achievements. 

If you do get good feedback - if someone says you are great, ask them why, tell me more, why was that good. And that is useful as then  you can reproduce it. 

R&D - my research and idea-based practice, 

Even if you get negative feedback, go back and ask for more detail, 

This is a cycle we all go though when we get negative feedback. Hopefully we can move into the Accept it and Change it bit. 
	* Deny it
	* Emotional about it
	* Justify it
	* Accept it
	* Change things
