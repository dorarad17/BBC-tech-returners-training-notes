REBECCA SALSBURY'S SESSION ON RESILIENCE
16 APRIL 2020

Question to us: 
What is difference between stress and pressure?
Pressure is a deadline and can be helpful. 
Stress is where it's getting to be a problem, where you have get physical indicators that you aren't able to move beyond. 
We all have our own indicators of whether the stress is manageable or not? Some things have enormous things happening, but seem to be taking things in their stride. And others are haveing things happen to them that they are not seeming to cope with. 
HSE - Stress is the adverse reaction a person has to excessive pressure - due to excessive demands being placed on them, when it gets too much or it's too much of a kind of pressure. 
WHO - work-related stress is when demands are not matched to their knowledge and expertise and challneges their ability to cope. 

What is resilience? 
It's your bounce-back-ability. 
The degree to which a person is able to pick themselves up and bounce back when things go badly. The process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, threats or significant sources of stress. 

It could be a failure when things don't go well. 
Such as your exam didn't go well. 
Or you were giving a presentation and haflway through you forgot what you were saying. 
Your resilience is how you pick yourself up and move on. 

Resilience is a skill you can learn. 
You can have lots of resilience - "okay, I screwed it up that time, but what I learned is that my notes need to be simpler so I can get visual clues very quickly". And when my resilience is even higher, I can say that 'it was only one presentation, half the people there didn't notice, the next one will be better'. 

or you can have low levels of resilience - you might exaggerate problems - "I totally screwed up that presentation". Ruminate or be unforgiving of others and yourself. "I fucked that up and it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I fucked it up". Catastrophising. Thinking about it all the time, unable to move on. 

Resilience is a continuum - sometimes you respond with more resilience than other times. Different types of situations, you'll have a different type of reaction to them. If you have had things happen to you in your life, you might be resilient to those things in the future, but other kinds of issues might give you a bigger wobble. 

It might depend on the day and what else is going on with you. Any of those factors can put you anywhere on that continuum between being resilient and not resilient. 

When did you expereince a failure, a setback, a mistake?
What did you say to yourself at the time? 
What do you think about it now? 
What are the techniques that you used to recover?

Oddly, I find it really hard to think of a failure or a mistake, which obviously isn't at all true, and therefore I think one of my techniques must be to not remember these things, so I can't focus on them. 

Did you talk to best friend? 
Drink loads of wine? 
How do you cope in the moment? Grit your teeth? 

INTO BREAKOUT SESSIONS OF SMALL GROUPS THEN BACK INTO MAIN ROOM

Sleep is a good one - come at it again the next day - stepping away from situations, rather than focusing on it. Go to bed - it might be better tomorrow. 

Get out of your own head - communicate with people you are working with, sharing problems with colleagues, lifts the weight and colleagues may also feel the same and appreciate those thoughts being voiced. Sometimes saying it out loud is enough to get it out of your head. And get some reassurance from them. 

Trying to get some perspective on it - long life, shit happens, if it won't matter to me in a week, a month, a year, then don't bother with it. 

Visualise it on paper, a todo list, get it all down on paper, get it mapped out and start prioritising it. 

Redefining failure and success, it's an interesting thing to redefine what that is to you. Not getting a good grade, redefine what you got out of going to uni, what was useful, there's still so much you can learn from an experience, like a job interview, even if you didn't get the job, you can reframe it so it wouldn't be a failure. You'd know that wasn't the right job for you and there is something that suits you better ahead. So you'd be grateful for the experience. 'Growth Mindset' it's a bit like moving the goalposts, so if you don't get success over here, then move the goalposts over there to match up with what happened. Success!

Being in the moment, maybe not thinking it has gone well, but do some deep breathing, to give yourself a break from the horrible voice inside your head. 

Stress balls - angry for your brain or angry for your body. Bash a ball. 

Let the past be in the past - don't remember all that stuff and don't bring it along with you in your life. 

Breathing for exercise. Settle all those thoughts and process through them. Don't dread getting up that hill at the end. Repetitive thing of exercise, thoughts can settle down rather than taking precedence so much. 

Menial tasks such as sewing or walking or cleaning, is good for processing stuff. I don't have to think about it, I get the before/after buzz of achieving somerhing. I can think about other things in the background and it's going to settle or I'll have a new idea. Satisfying autopilot kind of physical activity is good for discovering/managing head stuff. Instead of staring at a piece of paper and dealing with it at the front of your mind, you let it hum along in the background while you do something else. Let your subconscious get to work on it.  

Reslience can be developed:
- identify the problem, separate facts and feelings - why do I feel I have failed, what's gone wrong? Try to be objective, try to separate the facts of what has happened from how you feel about it. When you feel stressed, you are mashing together facts and feelings. So separating them out is easier - what's the trigger? and what's my reaction? When you just have the facts, it's easier to understand what is going on, check whether I am exaggerating? would someone else have observed it this way? am I thinking objectively about the facts? 

Reframing - growth mindset, moving the goalposts, choosing to think about the past as the past. You are able to choose what to think about what happens to you, as you get better at reframing, turning the thoughts into a more positive outlook. Especially if you have tendency to overfocus on what didn't go well rather than what did go well. 

Being kind to yourself - cut yourself some slack, you don't have to be perfect and no-one else is either. This can also be ending the streess and going to bed. Reframing can help you be kind of yourself. 

Turn to others, get out of your own head, ask for help, be okay with asking for help. Sometimes you just need to say it out loud to another person and someone to accept that you are having a reaction and hearing that. 

Learn from your past, what have you done before that has helped you? Learn what helps you be successful. Reflect on when you recovered from failure or a mistake. Remember a time when you breezed through it. I just put one foot in front of the other and moved on. 

Plan for the future, but don't overthink it and concentrate too much on it. I can visualise myself at the top of the hill, but I'm going to take it one step at a time. Focus on where you are right now - remain in the present. 

Take care of your physical health - allows you to be your best and cope with a new situation where you are under pressure or stressed. 

How readily available are these techniues to you when you are in it? 

REFRAMING - an exercise in choosing what to think. 
See Rebecca's PPT - p.13
Giving your head and heart the best chance of tackling that situation. Power Posing - the physical stance changes your outlook. Same as getting a good night's sleep. 

CIRCLE OF INFLUENCE
Circle of Control - the things you can control 
Circle of Influence - the things you can influence 
Circle of Concern - can't do much about economy or covid for example. 
About effectiveness not success 
So make sure you focus on the things you can control or influence, rather than concerns 

Reflect on what happened

Lockdown - learning everyday about what is important to me. Exercise, sleeping well, eating well, having meaningful conversations with colleagues and loved ones. Don't try too hard to have a long list of things you can do, just keep it small and manageable. 

Simone: Mindfulness is really hard to do, but definitely changes your brain. Can help you do all those things you have mentioned. It's like brain training. 

Shaming and negative self-talk and scolding yourself and being hard on yourself - if you've learnt that over time and it's become a habit. Notice that you're doing it and replace it with something else. 
Every time you get a negative thought - brush it aside and say 'nope'.
Gathering ideas from other people is a useful shortcut, but they might not work for me. 
When you have those nights that things start going around in your head and you're in half awake/half asleep state and you know you're not thinking rationally, but you just can't stop it. 
Whatever your tactic is at night time, they also work when you're awake. What are the things that get me to sleep and how might those apply on a grander scale to waking moments?

Interviews / Assessments will be happening, going ahead with new dates. Need to get it organised. Sam will email us tomorrow.
