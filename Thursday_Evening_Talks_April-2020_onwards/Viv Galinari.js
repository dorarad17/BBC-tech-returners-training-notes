Brazil - did business at Uni. 
Not customary for women to do engineering in Brazil
Masters in Innovation, but don't want to be an Innovation Manager, so decided to self-teach Coding. 
Spent 2 years teaching herself coding inensively. Went to Asia to have tiny rent and concentrate on coding. 
Did two months at startup where they didn't nurture and help beginners. 
First job at the BBC. Amazing, nurturing place.  

Creative Coding Background

JS based libraries for creative coding in the browswer, instant gratification, without needing a backend etc. Same as instagram filters. 
Processing CodeCircle
MaxiJS CodeCircle
A Frame Stitch
P5 Snake Game

All these things showed the BBC that she can learn and that she has a personal passion for it. 

Investing in things that are instant. 

** Use cases for AR - Augmented Reality

Able to make extra cash by making filters for brands. 
Facebook Ads, Shopify and Adidas E-com
Safari uses USDZ file to render AR in the browswer
Chrome have their own specifications and they might standardise AR for web for the future. 

E-com is big. So if you want to make your career future-proof, that's something to look at. 

** Spark AR - can do visual coding. Everything is reusable. 

You put all your assets on the right side, and everything is a child of teh devide. You drag and drop things into it. 
Load assets from elsewhere.

DEVELOPING EFFECTS

1. Develop in Spark AR and App for preview
2. Publish on Spark AR Hub
3. Share with friends

CAPABILITIES

Tracking people and places

Building Your Scene
And this is all out of the box. 

MY FILTERS:

Eyes on glasses
Earrings look like faces
Multiple eyes

STATS (on Instagram): 

"Weirdest" Top Model edition

BIGGEST LEARNINGS as a freelancer making Instagram filters:

If you want to make any money, you have to go to places and linkedin and go to agencies. 
Instagram is just to show a portfolio. 

It's worth investing time learning a software that has such a good distribution channel

CREATIVE PROCESS:

Snake on the face
3D asset that maps onto the face. You can download that from Spark AR. i.e. download face assets here. 

Spark AR - Create New - or use one of the readymade ones. Create a new Blank Project and it opens the new window. 
Add object, Face Tracker. 
Add face Mash (this checked material is because tehre is nothing there)
Can put materials there - default material. Can make it bigger/smaller. 
Pull in Asset of the snaker her friend drew. 
Double click on material to change properties of material. 
Can click on retouch to remove wrinkles! 
Can click on New Mask and put the snake onto that. 
And then pull that onto your face and it will move with you. 
And it makes you a filter
Can add directional light - colour them
Can blur the edges of the filter so you don't get hard edge to the mask at the hairline. 
Use the Patch Editor to bring menus out 
Can test it by sending to instagram. Take a video of yourself on your phone using the filter. Can publish by using Upload. Has to be max 4MB for instagram on phones. Publish new effect. 

YOu can also do everyting by coding by opening the scripting file and using JavaScript. 

If you have a design background, your filters will look good. If you have engineering background, your filters will be special becuase not many people will know how else to do that. 

The earring one was self-scripted. 

Best to do Spark tutorials first and master the interface and then go into the code and you need to look at documentation more for that. 
It's React JavaScript. 

Jyoti asked: Is there scope at the BBC to do really experimental creative stuff? 
This AR stuff is very experimental, so it's nice to have a job that is building a career that is more solid. And make money. Becuase the creative industries expect you to do everything for free. 

Viv did the foundation course on that visual thing. 
The more you learn, the more fun you have. Becuase you're not stuck on little errors. 

Jyoti asks about Viv's BBC Interview
Soft skills are underrated. If you can talk well, that really makes a difference. 
1.5 hours chatting. Everyone is so nice. 
BBC was easiest out of all the interviews Viv did. They gave Viv an app to implement. It was plain JS and there were a number of things you could choose to implement. 30-40 mins. 
Then had a chat with Andy and Jess. 
Then that was it. 

Then went to two other places to do interviews. 

Alex asked: Have you done any generative art in the browser?
If you want ot make music with code, I shared some libraries. They are JS. Quite small libraries. 
I go to ogrerave and search for tidal cycle, they make music with code. You can go to their gigs - you go to gig and watch them coding. They make the visuals with code too. Somerset House there is a lot of things you can go to to learn. Hack spaces too. P5. 

creative coding in JS
Daniel Schiffman - codetrain on youtube
Will give you something to show

Wesbos - 30 days of JS - more functional things. 

Spark AR is just for face filters. And they have closed their API so you can't add other libraries. 

Things are heading to be more augmented. It's pretty fun and so rewarding. When people think you are a genius but it's just that you try hard. 

When you get a steep learning curve it's hard to get a sense of gratification. So these fun things are to keep you creative and fun. 

SuperHi is the place that Viv did her website learning that is focused on design rather than just computer science.
