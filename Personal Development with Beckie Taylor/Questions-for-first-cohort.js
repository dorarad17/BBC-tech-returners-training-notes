What to ask first cohort? 

What’s it like to work for BBC

What’s your life been like since you finished? 

Are the jobs super challenging and full on? 

When you finished the course, did you feel competent in your new job? i.e. were you lost? 

Has anyone been promoted already or is already looking to be promoted?
