Group Project Kick-off

PRESENTATION EVENING
Celebrate what we've achieved. 
Opportunity to meet teams and employer and engineers and so on. Last time had CTO, asking good questions. 
A time to reflect on our own personal journies

Introduction
Our team
Yourself - Name, short background, role in the project. Frontend, backend, requests. 

Why, How, What
80% is why and how we did it, they are really connecting with how we interacted as a team. Simon Sinek - The Golden Circle. How leaders inspire action. It is starting with 'why'. 
20% is showing what we did

They know we can't check their technical ability, but they can see how we were like as a team. 

Why that app idea, MVP is minimum viable product. There are other ideas we had, but only chose to develop 6 of them. 
How - what processes we followed, daily standups, scrum process, what did we do with version control, how did we collaborate. 

They might ask why we chose to do the user experience like that. 

If you had more time, what would you have done. 

WHY
The problem our idea solves
Why we decided on that application

HOW
How we worked as a team
Commmunication (slack, how we structured our time around our other responsibilites, how we were 'allowing' of different people's scheduels, how we worked within those, REsponsbilites, 
Processes - perhaps we did things to ensure quality, like someone did the dev and someone else tested it. 
WE followed Kanban and used Trello to do that. Start, In Progress, Done. 

Tools utilised, and what they were used for
Trello, github, VSCode etc. 

Things we used that 13 weeks ago weren't a thing. 
Even things that everyone did, still put it on our slides, pop all the technologies up there. List React, Serverless, technologies that were outside of the course. Make a big deal about it, that was something we didn't cover on the course, such as browserstack, allows you to test your site on other browsers. Went away and learnt that. Using APIs from another service. James hasn't taught us to use other people's APIs. 

Challenges
There will be challenges, how we overcame them, Talk more about how we overcame, rather than the challenge itself. We had a discussion and we made this decision. 

The most interesting bits is how we got there, rather than the destination. 

Future roadmap of product. 
How to get lots of poeple to login, but will expand it out to multiple users. 

DEMO of our application
1 Can do a live demo - working on localhost:3000 and talk it through. 
Practice and have a video backup. 
2 Video, with our voice going over it already. 
3 Video, with us talking live over it at the moment. 
Always have a video backup - can do it with quicktime on a mac - you're doing a runthrough of your mac and it shows when you're clicking things and so on. 

Aim for around 10-15 minutes. Aim for 12-13 minutes. And probably have 2-3 mins questions. 

Don't have to show EVERY feature of our app, if we've got lots of ways of doing things, don't need to spend 20 mins talking about our apps

Take photos of our meetings - of making decisions or database diagrams - and put them on our slides - to make it visual. 
Whiteboarding is fun and useful
Highlight transferable skills (background) - 2 sentences per person. Small opportunity to say who I am and have my personal stamp on it. My role in it and my background. Want them to go away knowing a little bit about me. Not much, but a bit.

James' speech: 
In the project I focused on teh front end but did some work on backend too. Non technical about my background, in my spare time, what I do, spend time with my little boy. 
 

Starts 4pm - ends 9pm. 



Pair working
Liveshare - microsoft
Zoom - screenshare
Microsoft Teams - don't use, takes masses of memory. 

Use one DB instance (and create a database within it)
Save all your SQL - do a database dump in case you want to continue the project on your own. So you've got all the info from the project. 

James tends to use PowerPoint or Google Slides. 
5-second rule - Mel Robbins - book basically about activation energy - so your brain takes 5 seconds to talk you out of doing something. Before your brain says 'stop', start moving. 

Brenee Brown - vulnerability - you know you're out in front if you've got arrows on your arse. 

It's a privilege to be up there talking about ideas. 

James - put him in a slack message with all of team, work as a team first, then ask James.
