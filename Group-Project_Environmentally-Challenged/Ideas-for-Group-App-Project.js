Ideas for Group App Project

SOUL LINES

Beautiful idea of artists Sophia New and Daniel Belasco Rogers. planbperformance.net

They had this idea back in something like 2005, but didn't actually get the funding and support to realise it. So it's been sitting on their website waiting every since. 

We have their permission to work on the idea, need to have them credited that it's their idea and artwork and with their name on etc. 

Idea that your soul can only travel at walking pace and so when you get in a car or train or plane, you part with your soul. So you get on a plane to Australia. Your soul starts to follow you at walking pace. A few weeks later maybe it’s made it to the south of France and then you fly home and it turns around and it starts walking back to the UK. And when you are reunited, it pings with pleasure! 

App could show where you are and where your soul is and so it's location based, which might be interesting to work on as lots of apps seem to have that. 

We could plot some different people into it - for example Greta Thurnberg's sailing trip across the Atlantic, we could see where her soul met up with her again. Although she is always on a train going somewhere, so perhaps her soul is going crazy ... 


COCKTAILS

Then we also had an idea about a moody cocktail generator didn’t we? You type in your mood i.e. I’m frustrated with my backend’ and it returns ‘you need a margarita my friend, with the ingredients list and method!’
So we’d have a lot of different moods or feelings and then match them up to cocktails. 
Quite a basic idea, haven’t thought how that could be developed on. 
MICROPERFORMANCES

This is an artwork myself and my collaborator Andrew Mottershead made back in 2003, and which we've done many times over the years, most recently a couple of weeks ago in Milton Keynes Gallery. 

So when you enter a space there’s a table with cards laid out face down. You choose a card and on it is a playful and slightly subversive instruction for a small performance, based on the social context of each space. 

So you do the performance and then you peel off the sticker and mark the location of your performance. And the dots build up during the event, across people's bodies and the architecture.  

For the App, you could select a particular context from a dropdown menu. Contexts could be like Family Get-together, Party, Political March, Office, etc. 

And then the App could give you instructions for small interventions to make. So for Family Get-together, it could be 'Start a chat about Brexit'. Or Party 'Introduce yourself to a stranger' or for Political March 'Shout Louder' or for an Office scenario 'Insist others pass through a doorway first' or 'Run to be the first to the coffee machine’. 

We've got hundreds of these instructions for different contexts, which we can use. But we could also as a group write new ones, which might be fun. 

So that could be a basic App with the user selecting the type of event they are at and then the instructions being delivered to them every few minutes. 

And then developments to the App if we had time. 

We could allow people to select the regularity of when they receive the instructions. 

We could bring in the red dots, so we could add a locative element - so when you've done the performance, you click Done, and this marks your location on a map and tags it with the performance you did, so the red dots would build up all over your map and act as a reminder of the events you've been to and what you did there. 


SEASONAL FRUIT AND VEG

The idea that wherever you are, you can select a food item and it will tell you whether it's in season and also will tell you it's likely journey so you can make a decision. 

So it would use locative technology and time/seasons. 

i.e. bananas, never in season in the UK, but are shipped here rather than flown, so maybe not so terrible. So maybe they would be return with an Amber rating. 

Apples would be fine now in the UK, so they would be graded Green.

But then the grapes we buy are never in season in the UK, but in summer and autumn they shipped from Spain, so maybe Amber, but in February, they are flown from South Africa. So they would be graded Red. 

But when Simone flies to South Africa, the App is locative, so suddenly grapes are absolutely fine and maybe cabbages are not!

It could be rather lovely as you move through different time zones around the world, different fruit and veg come into season. 

Then I googled it and there is already an App that does this in some way. 

But then I googled Cheese and Wine pairing and there is already an App that does that too!



Ideas for Group App Project

Microperformance / People Series type thing where you input your context and your naughtiness level and it returns an instruction

Soph and Dan’s Soul Lines
[Soul Lines – plan b – belasco new](https://planbperformance.net/works/soul-lines/)

Something ethical/eco/carbon - i.e. you put in avocados and it returns the current thinking on whether to eat them. 

How about if it is seasonal/time- and location-based, with some info about the choice? 
**Satsumas** and it returns 'it's summer in the UK, satsumas are only in season in South Africa'. Satsumas will likely have flown to the UK - high carbon. 
**Bananas** are not grown in the UK. Will likely have come from Costa Rica or Panama. Sent by ship not air. 

Based on the Cern idea of a parallel universe, something poetic and beautiful that gives people a sense of themselves within a larger space.
